# templateProject

In this project I declare the templates of the software projects that I will create in the future.
In this way I have a reference and a structure standard.

## Branches

In this section I describe the branches of the project.
Every branch, out of the _master_ , is an unstable version of the template of a type of project in a specific language.

The branches are:

* _master_: stable version
* _python-data-eng_ : this template is described by (this)[ https://blog.devgenius.io/keeping-your-data-pipelines-organized-fa387247d59epost ] post "Keeping you data organized" by (Felipe Netto)[https://medium.com/@flpncc] .
